        <img src="images/R0000707.JPG" alt="Tokyo Skytree" />

          so many wards and neighbourhoods to choose from, everyone is bound to
          find something that suits their taste. From busy areas like Shibuya
          and its legendary crossing to more traditional spots like Asakusa,
          Tokyo truly has something for everyone. Places like Shibuya, Shinjuku,
          Akihabara and Asakusa are only the tip of the iceberg, and it seems
          like possibilities are endless, so please explore Tokyo to your
          heart's content and find your own Tokyo!

        <h2>Yokohama</h2>
        <img src="images/R0000041.JPG" alt="Minato Mirai" />
        <p>
          The 2nd biggest city in Japan also has a lot to offer! Its proximity
          to Tokyo makes it an easy day trip destination. Between Yokohama
          Chinatown, which is the biggest one in Japan, the unique looking Red
          Brick Warehouse and Minato Mirai which will give you a look into the
          future, Yokohama is sure to surprise you. Don't leave too early,
          Minato Mirai is even more impressive during nighttime! And that's
          without mentioning some lesser known places in Yokohama like
          Sankei-en...

        <h2>Osaka</h2>
        <img src="images/R0001723.JPG" alt="Takoyaki in Osaka" />
        <p>
          Another extremely popular spot with tourists, Osaka's reputation for
          having great nightlife and street food options has been rightfully
          earned. If you want to get your okonomiyaki and takoyaki fix, Osaka is
          the place to go.

        <h2>Nagoya</h2>
        <img src="images/R0001344.JPG" alt="Mirai Tower" />
        <p>
          Often ignored by tourists in spite of being the
          <b>4th biggest city in Japan</b>, Nagoya has everything you'd expect
          from a major city while retaining very high livability. It's very
          walkable and relatively free of crowds, however it doesn't mean there
          is nothing to do as plenty of interesting shrines and temples await
          you there, along with some lesser known areas such as Shikemichi.
          Nagoya is the perfect place to enjoy Japanese city living at a more
          leisurely pace.

        <h2>Nara</h2>
        <img src="images/R0001581.JPG" alt="Nara Deer" />
        <p>
          When one thinks of Nara... The first thing that comes to mind is deer,
          and for good reason since they're quite ubiquitous. However, Nara's
          appeal goes beyond deer. Nara is a place shrouded in history and it
          being the first capital of Japan shouldn't be overlooked. With so many
          shrines to choose from and deer to fawn at, Nara is guaranteed to be
          hit on your next Japan trip. Pro tip: check out Naramachi for a
          slower, quieter Nara experience!

        <h2>Kawagoe</h2>
        <img src="images/R0001939.JPG" alt="Toki no Kane" />
        <p>
          Often nicknamed "Koedo" for Little Edo, Kawagoe shines with its
          traditional-looking streets. With Toki no Kane as a backdrop, you will
          feel like you just stepped back in time into a different era. An easy
          day-trip from Tokyo, it's a perfect place to enjoy cute cafes and lots
          of good food.

      <div>
        <h2>Kamakura</h2>
        <img src="images/R0002136.JPG" alt="Kotoku-in" />
        <p>
          If you love temples and shrines, don't miss out on Kamakura! Kotoku-in
          and its great buddha statue is sure to leave an impression on anyone
          while other temples such as Hasedera will impress with their beauty.
          Make sure to get an Enoden ticket to get around the different points
          of interest!

        <h2>Enoshima</h2>
        <img src="images/R0002271.JPG" alt="Enoshima Sea Candle" />
        <p>
          Located in the city of Fujisawa in Kanagawa Prefecture, Enoshima is a
          charming island to visit, whether you do it alone or accompanied. Can
          be visited in a single afternoon as part of a Kamakura-Enoshima
          itinerary, however for a more enjoyable experience I would strongly
          recommend allocating a full day to this visit!
